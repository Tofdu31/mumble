Coding guide:
Use rem or em for units in padding, margin, font size etc.
Use vh, vw, % for units in responsive layouts.
All colors used should be variables - Can use darken & lighten functions on existing
colors to implement style guide
If it's a general style, put it in elements
If it's going to be used by one class or id, put it in the appropriate section
Make your selectors specific
