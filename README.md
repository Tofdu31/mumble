## Front-End Dependancies:
```
* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome
* jQuery
* AureliaJS
```

## Development Dependancies:
```
* SASS
* Gulp (Optional)
```


## Front-End Setup

At the current stage I am experimenting with AureliaJS for client-side interaction, it uses Vanilla ES2016 JavaScript so development doesn't
include 'framework' explicit code. 

* Install NodeJS >= 4.x
    * You can [download it here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* NPM >= 3
    * This will automatically be installed with node, if it is already installed then make sure it is updated to >= version 3.

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can install the Aurelia CLI itself. From the command line, use npm to install the CLI globally:

```
npm install aurelia-cli -g

```

```
n̶p̶m̶ ̶i̶n̶s̶t̶a̶l̶l̶  (Currently there is a bug with trying to run apps that you have installed it's dependancies through NPM)

```
Instead, create a new aurelia project and then copy it's tempProj/node_modules folder into the front DIR. You can then delete the tempProj folder.
```
au new
```

Finally, we need to compile the scss files into css:
```
cd front
sass --update scss:css
```

## Running the App

Now run the following command inside the 'front' directory.

```
au run 
```

> Note: It should now be running in localhost:9000, 

> (optional with --watch flag): Updating code will automatically build and refresh your browser. Good for development
```
au run --watch
```
