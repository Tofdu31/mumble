# mumble

Mumble is a self hosted secure chat application meant for businesses and teams to collaborate. 

## HTML Demo
[Mumble chat demo](http://jphilipos.surge.sh/mumble)

## Scripts included:
```
* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome
* jQuery
* AureliaJS
```

## Front-End Setup

At the current stage I am experimenting with AureliaJS for client-side interaction, it uses Vanilla ES2016 JavaScript so development doesn't
include 'framework' explicit code. 

* Install NodeJS >= 4.x
    * You can [download it here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can install the Aurelia CLI itself. From the command line, use npm to install the CLI globally:

```
npm install aurelia-cli -g

```

Now, navigate to the 'front' Directory & install it's dependancies (this might take a while)

```
npm install
```
## Building The App

```
au build
```

## Running the App

```
au run
```

> Note: It should now be running in localhost:9000, updating code will automatically build and refresh your browser.
