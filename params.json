From the command line, use npm to install the CLI globally also ensure that NPM is up to date:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install aurelia-cli npm -g\r\n\r\n```\r\nNow, navigate to the 'front' Directory and install it's dependancies (this might take a while)\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we need to compile the scss files into css:\r\n```\r\ncd front\r\nsass --update scss:css\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Running the App\r\n\r\nNow run the following command inside the 'front' directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\nau run \r\n```\r\n\r\n> Note: It should now be running in localhost:9000, \r\n\r\n> (optional with --watch flag): Updating code will automatically build and refresh your browser. Good for development\r\n```\r\nau run --watch\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Failed to Launch/Load in Browser\r\n\r\nIf you get an error in the console when typing 'au run', please report it.\r\n\r\n> failed to load in the browser after launching\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes trying to load the app in the browser will result in a blank screen. Right click and click 'Inspect'.\r\nNavigate to the 'console' tab, if you see an error at the top saying 'jQuery' cannot be detected. OR you scroll down and it says (0, bootstrap).*.... is not a function. \r\n\r\nThen follow these steps: \r\n\r\n1. Navigate to /front/node_modules/jquery/dist\r\n2. Open the jquery.js file with a text editor.\r\n3. Comment or remove lines 7 through 9 (which starts with = 'if (typeof jQuery === 'undefined') {')\r\n4. Save\r\n5. Launch the application again.\r\n\r\nThis happens as sometimes JQuery is not detected and ends up cancelling out bootstrap (as bootstrap can't operate without JQuery) resulting in an unhandled error which \r\ncancels the rendering of the UI.\r\n\r\n> failed to launch in a linux environment\r\n\r\nThis is caused due to a bug in the Aurelia-CLI not being able to correctly find the dependancies, in order to fix this replace all '\\\\' in the front/aurelia_project/aurelia.json file into '/'.\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n|                      |                                          |\r\n|:---------------------|:-----------------------------------------|\r\n| **Author:**          | Jonathan Phillipos [jaeko44](https://github.com/jaeko44)\r\n| **Copyright:**       | Copyright (c) 2016 RMIT\r\n| **License:**         | Apache License, Version 2.0\r\n\r\n",
